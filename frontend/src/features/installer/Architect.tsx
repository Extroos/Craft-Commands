# Running This For Real: What's Next?

You are currently viewing the **CraftCommand Web Interface**. To turn this into a fully functional server manager that runs actual Minecraft instances on your machine or a VPS, specific infrastructure is required.

## 1. The "Backend" Problem
Browsers cannot directly launch \`java -jar server.jar\` on your computer due to security sandboxing.
*   **For Local Use:** This website needs to be wrapped in **Electron** or **Tauri**. These technologies allow the web code (React) to execute system commands (like starting Java) on your computer.
*   **For Remote Hosting:** You need a dedicated backend service (written in Node.js, Go, or Rust) running on the server that listens for commands from this dashboard.

## 2. Do I need Docker?
Professional hosting panels (like Pterodactyl) use **Docker**, and it is highly recommended for CraftCommand too.
*   **Why?** Docker isolates the server. If a malicious plugin tries to delete files, it can only see inside its container, not your entire Windows/Linux PC.
*   **Requirement:** To run the full backend version of this app, you would need **Docker Desktop** installed.

## 3. Networking & Port Forwarding
If you host on your home PC, your friends cannot join unless you "open the door."
*   **Port Forwarding:** You must log into your router (usually \`192.168.1.1\`) and forward port \`25565\` (TCP & UDP) to your PC's local IP address.
*   **Tunneling:** Alternatively, use tools like **Playit.gg** or **ngrok** to generate a public link without touching router settings.

## 4. Java Runtime Environment
Minecraft requires specific Java versions to run.
*   **Minecraft 1.18+:** Requires **Java 17** or **Java 21**.
*   **Minecraft 1.16 & older:** Requires **Java 8** or **Java 11**.
*   *Automation:* A proper backend would automatically download and select the correct Java version for you.

## Summary Checklist
To take this from a "Simulation" to a "Product":
1.  [ ] **Backend API** (Node.js/Go) to handle file writes and process spawning.
2.  [ ] **Docker** for security and environment isolation.
3.  [ ] **Public IP** or **Tunnel** for external connections.

        content: `
# How to Install a Modpack

Installing a modpack allows you to play with hundreds of mods at once. Follow these steps to set it up on your server.

## Step 1: Get the Server Files
1.  Go to **CurseForge** or **Modrinth**.
2.  Find your desired modpack (e.g., *Better MC*, *All The Mods 9*).
3.  Click **Files** and look for "Server Files" or "Server Pack".
4.  Download and extract the \`.zip\` file on your computer.

## Step 2: Prepare the Server
1.  Go to the **Files** tab in this dashboard.
2.  **Delete** existing files (like \`world\`, \`mods\`, \`config\`) if you are switching from a different version. *Make a backup first!*
3.  Keep \`server.properties\` if you want to keep your settings, otherwise delete it too.

## Step 3: Upload Files
1.  Go to **Settings** and get your **SFTP Credentials**.
2.  Use a program like **FileZilla** or **WinSCP** to connect to your server.
3.  Drag and drop all the extracted modpack files (the \`mods\`, \`config\`, \`scripts\` folders) into the server folder.

## Step 4: Configure Startup
1.  Go to the **Settings** tab.
2.  Change the **Server Jar File** name to match the jar inside your modpack (usually named \`forge-1.20.1.jar\` or \`fabric-server-launch.jar\`).
3.  Click **Save**.

## Step 5: Start & Play
1.  Go to the **Console** and click **Start**.
2.  The first start will take a while as it downloads libraries.
3.  If it stops, check the console—you might need to accept the EULA in \`eula.txt\`.

        content: `
# Hardware Sizing Guide

Running a Minecraft server requires specific resources. Use this guide to determine what your PC or hosting plan can handle.

## RAM Requirements
The amount of RAM you allocate in **Settings** determines what kind of server you can run.

| Server Type | Recommended RAM | Player Count | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vanilla / Paper** | 2GB - 4GB | 1-10 Players | Great for basic survival with friends. |
| **Plugin Heavy** | 4GB - 8GB | 10-30 Players | For servers with 30+ plugins (Essentials, McMMO). |
| **Light Modpack** | 4GB - 6GB | 1-5 Players | Packs with <50 mods (Vanilla+). |
| **Heavy Modpack** | 8GB - 12GB+ | 1-10 Players | Large packs like *All The Mods* or *RLCraft*. |

## CPU Importance
Minecraft is "single-threaded," meaning a CPU with **high speed (GHz)** is better than a CPU with many cores.
*   **Good:** Intel Core i5/i7/i9 (9th gen+) or AMD Ryzen 5/7/9 (3000 series+).
*   **Bad:** Old office CPUs (Pentium, Celeron) or weak laptop CPUs.

## Storage
*   Always use an **SSD**. Running a server on an old HDD will cause lag when loading chunks.

        content: `
# Dashboard Features Guide

Learn how to manage your server like a pro using the built-in tools.

## 📦 Backups
**Never lose your progress.**
1.  Go to the **Backups** tab.
2.  Click **Create Backup**.
3.  You can lock backups to prevent accidental deletion.
4.  *Tip:* Create a backup before installing new plugins or mods!

## 📅 Automation (Schedules)
**Make the server run itself.**
1.  Go to **Schedules**.
2.  Create a new task (e.g., "Daily Restart").
3.  Set the time (Cron syntax). Example: \`0 0 * * *\` runs every day at midnight.
4.  Add a command: \`restart\`.

## 📁 File Management (SFTP)
**For moving large files.**
The web file manager is great for quick edits, but for large uploads (like worlds or modpacks), use SFTP.
1.  Download **FileZilla**.
2.  Go to **Settings** in the dashboard to copy your \`sftp://\` address and username.
3.  Use your login password to connect.

        content: `
# Optimization Tips

Is your server lagging? Try these quick fixes before upgrading your hardware.

## 1. Use Paper (Not Spigot/Vanilla)
If you aren't running mods, always use **Paper** software. It is 2x faster than Vanilla Minecraft.
*   *How to switch:* Create a new server and select **Paper** as the software.

## 2. Pre-Generate Your World
Generating new terrain lags the server the most. Use a plugin like **Chunky** to generate the world while you sleep.
1.  Install the **Chunky** plugin.
2.  Run command: \`chunky radius 5000\`
3.  Run command: \`chunky start\`
4.  Wait for it to finish before letting players join.

## 3. Lower View Distance
In **Settings** or \`server.properties\`:
*   Change \`view-distance\` from \`10\` to \`7\`.
*   Change \`simulation-distance\` from \`10\` to \`5\`.
*   This drastically reduces the workload on your CPU.

## 4. Aikar's Flags
In the **Settings** tab, ensure **"Enable Aikar's Flags"** is checked. These are special Java startup codes designed specifically to make Minecraft run smoother.

        description: "How to set up your Discord Bot and make it go online.",
        content: `
# Discord Bot: Full Integration Guide

Enable high-fidelity control of your infrastructure directly from your Discord server. Follow these steps to establish a professional persistent connection.

## Step 1: Create a Discord Application
To begin the handshake, you need an application profile on the Discord network.
1.  Access the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2.  Select **"New Application"** and define a name (e.g., "CraftCommand Bot").
3.  On the left navigation sidebar, select the **"Bot"** section.
4.  *Note:* You can change the bot's name/icon at any time in the portal under "General Information".

## Step 2: Enable Gateway Intents (CRITICAL)
For the bot to read messages, process commands, and see server members, you **must** authorize these privileged intents. Without these, the bot will fail to initialize.
1.  Within the **Bot** tab, scroll to the **"Privileged Gateway Intents"** section.
2.  Toggle **ON** "Presence Intent", "Server Members Intent", and most importantly, **"Message Content Intent"**.
3.  Click **"Save Changes"** to commit the authorization.

## Step 3: Secure Your Credentials
Copy the unique identifiers needed for CraftCommand to impersonate your bot.
1.  **Bot Token:** In the **Bot** tab, click **"Reset Token"** (or "Copy") to generate your access key. **Keep this secret!**
2.  **Client ID:** Navigate to the **"OAuth2"** tab and copy the unique **"Client ID"**.

## Step 4: The Handshake (Making the Bot Online)
Many users ask: *Do I need to keep the Discord app open?* 
*   **The Answer:** No. The bot goes online when **CraftCommand** establishes a bridge to Discord using your secret token.
*   **Action:** Open the **Integrations** tab in your Craft Commands dashboard. 
*   **Paste:** Enter your **Token** and **Client ID** into the Bot Authentication card.
*   **Update:** Click **"Update Bot Instance"**. The Craft Commands backend will now handle the lifecycle and connection automatically.

## Step 5: Authorization & Invitation
Generate a secure link to invite the bot to your primary guild.
1.  Go to **OAuth2** -> **URL Generator**.
2.  Scopes: Select the \`bot\` and \`applications.commands\` scopes.
3.  Permissions: Select \`Administrator\` (or specific permissions: *Manage Channels*, *Send Messages*, *Embed Links*).
4.  Paste the generated URL into your browser to authorize the bot for your server.

## Step 6: Slash Command Synchronization
Before commands appear in your server, you must register them with the Discord API.
1.  In the **Integrations** dashboard, ensure the bot shows as **Online**.
2.  Click the **"Sync Cmds"** button. 
3.  **Global vs. Guild:** If you don't provide a **Guild ID**, command propagation is "Global" and can take up to an hour to appear. Providing your Server ID as the **Guild ID** triggers instant synchronization.

## Step 7: Zero-Duplicate Architecture
To prevent spam, CraftCommand uses a "Managed Listener" pattern:
*   **Lifecycle Awareness:** Every time the bot reconnects, it purges all old event listeners. This ensures you never receive two "Server Started" messages for the same event.
*   **Debounced Player Events:** During mass joins (e.g., after a restart), the bot debounces notifications for 5 seconds to keep your channel clean.
*   **Smart Triggers:** The bot is internally wired to the **Auto-Healing Service**, notifying you instantly if a recovery protocol is initiated.

## FAQ
*   **Q: Does it cost money?** No, creating and hosting a Discord bot via Craft Commands is completely free.
*   **Q: Why doesn't it reply?** Ensure "Message Content Intent" is enabled in the portal and you have clicked **"Sync Cmds"**.

    autohealing: {
        title: "Auto-Healing & Recovery",
        icon: <Zap size={18} />,
        description: "How the autonomous stabilization engine works.",
        content: `
# Auto-Healing: The Intelligence Engine

CraftCommand features a proactive stabilization layer designed to handle crashes, hangs, and "zombie" processes without manual intervention.

## 1. Pattern Recognition (Logs)
The engine constantly monitors the STDOUT of your Minecraft servers. It looks for specific failure patterns:
*   **Out of Memory (OOM):** "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError"
*   **Port Binding Issues:** "FAILED TO BIND TO PORT"
*   **EULA Violations:** "Stopping server (Accept EULA)"
*   **Corrupt JARs:** "Error: Unable to access jarfile"

## 2. Advanced Health Checks (Socket Tests)
Beyond just checking if the process is "running," the system performs **Deep Health Checks**:
*   Every 60 seconds (configurable), the system attempts a low-level socket handshake with the server's port.
*   If the process is running but the socket times out, the system marks the instance as **HUNG**.

## 3. Automated Recovery Protocol
When a failure or "Hung" state is confirmed, the system triggers the following sequence:
1.  **Diagnosis:** The system analyzes the last 1000 lines of logs to identify the "Rule ID" that triggered the failure.
2.  **Stabilization:** If a known fix exists (e.g., auto-accepting EULA or clearing a ghost port), it is applied automatically.
3.  **Restart:** The process is force-stopped and re-initialized using the original startup flags.
4.  **Notification:** If integrated, a "Recovery Protocol Active" alert is sent to your Discord.

## 4. Loop Prevention
To prevent "Restart Loops" (e.g., if a server is crashing due to a fatal bug in a mod), the system allows only **3 attempts per 10 minutes**. If stability is not reached, it halts and flags the server for manual intervention.

    backups: {
        title: "Atomic Backups",
        icon: <Package size={18} />,
        description: "Safe-mode snapshots and restoration architecture.",
        content: `
# Atomic Backups: Data Integrity First

The backup system in CraftCommand is designed for safety. We use an "Atomic" approach to ensure that a failed backup or restore never corrupts your server files.

## 1. Safety Snapshots
When you click **"Create Backup"**, the system:
*   Generates a unique timestamped manifest.
*   Archives the server directory into a professional ZIP format.
*   **Smart Inclusion:** Automatically skips unnecessary temporary files like \`session.lock\`, \`.lck\` files, and the \`logs/latest.log\` to save space.

## 2. Atomic Restoration (The "Swap" Pattern)
Restoring a backup is the most dangerous operation. CraftCommand handles it using a failsafe pattern:
1.  **Preparation:** A temporary folder is created.
2.  **Safety Buffer:** Your *current* live files are moved into this temporary buffer instead of being deleted.
3.  **Extraction:** The backup is extracted into the now-empty server directory.
4.  **Verification:** The system checks if the critical files (like \`server.properties\`) exist.
5.  **Finalize:** If successful, the temporary buffer is deleted.
6.  **Rollback:** If extraction fails, the system automatically moves your live files back from the buffer. **Your server stays exactly as it was.**

## 3. World-Only Backups
Save storage space by backing up only the terrain data.
*   The system analyzes your \`server.properties\` to find the specific \`level-name\` folder.
*   It also automatically grabs \`world_nether\` and \`world_the_end\` for Vanilla/Paper servers.
*   This mode typically reduces backup size by **70-90%** if you have many mods.

## 4. Manifest Tracking
All backups are indexed in a \`manifest.json\`. If you move files manually via SFTP, the system "Discovers" them automatically on the next scan, recovering metadata like creation dates and file sizes.

        description: "Ensuring port availability and internal routing.",
        content: `
# Networking & Port Integrity

Managing multiple Minecraft servers requires strict control over networking handles. CraftCommand includes a built-in **Port Protection Engine**.

## 1. Ghost Process Purging
One of the most common server errors is \`FAILED TO BIND TO PORT\`. This happens when a previous instance didn't close properly and is still "holding" the port.
*   **Startup Verification:** Before launching any server, the system checks if the port is busy.
*   **Heuristic Killing:** If a "Ghost" process is found, the system forcefully terminates it to clear the path for your new server instance.

## 2. Port Conflict Prevention
*   The system tracks the port allocation for every server in your infrastructure.
*   If you attempt to start two servers on port \`25565\`, the system will intercept the command and warn you before the process even attempts to boot.

## 3. External Sync Loop
Every 15 seconds, a "Sync Loop" runs to detect "Unmanaged" processes. 
*   If you start a server manually via a command line outside of CraftCommand, the panel will detect the port is bound and show a special **UNMANAGED** status on the dashboard.
*   This allows you to see what's happening on your machine even if it wasn't started through the web interface.

## 4. Execution Engines (Native vs Docker)
*   **Native Engine:** Runs Java directly on your OS. It is fast and has zero overhead but shares the host network space.
*   **Docker Engine:** Runs the server inside a virtualized network. This provides much higher security, as the container has its own private "Internal" IP, and only the specific Minecraft port is exposed to the host.

    schedules: {

        icon: <Bot size={18} />,
        description: "How automated tasks and Cron work.",
        content: `
# Scheduling Engine (Automation)

Automation is the heart of professional server management. Our engine uses a robust **Node-Cron** implementation to handle tasks with precision.

## 1. Precision Timing (Cron Syntax)
We use standard Linux Cron syntax for maximum flexibility. 
*   \`0 0 * * *\`: Runs at exactly midnight every day.
*   \`*/30 * * * *\`: Runs every 30 minutes.
*   \`0 4 * * 0\`: Runs every Sunday at 4:00 AM.

## 2. Command Pipeline
When a schedule triggers, it doesn't just "reset" the server. It enters a dedicated command pipeline:
1.  **Broadcast:** If configured, the system sends a \`say\` command to Minecraft to warn users about the upcoming event.
2.  **Grace Period:** The system waits for players to finish their activities.
3.  **Execution:** The primary action (Restart, Backup, or Stop) is executed.

## 3. Persistence & Survivability
*   Schedules are stored in \`data/settings.json\`.
*   If the panel is restarted, the Scheduling Engine scans all pending tasks and re-aligns them with the current system clock immediately upon boot.
*   **Task Locking:** Scheduled tasks are locked during execution to prevent "Double-Triggers" if a long-running task (like a massive backup) takes longer than the interval.

## 4. Multi-Server Coordination
You can create "Master Schedules" that target multiple servers at once, ensuring that your entire network stays synchronized without manual intervention.

        content: `
# Smart Import System

Bringing an existing server into CraftCommand is designed to be a "Zero-Config" experience. Our **ImportService** performs a deep heuristic analysis of your files.

## 1. Fast ZIP Analysis (Handshake)
When you upload a ZIP, we don't just dump the files.
*   **Archiver Stream:** We use \`adm-zip\` to peek inside the archive before extraction.
*   **Nested Detection:** If your ZIP contains a folder which *itself* contains the server (e.g., \`my-server/server.jar\`), the system detects this "Improper Nesting" and automatically flattens it for you.

## 2. Heuristic Analysis
The service scans your files to determine your configuration:
*   **Software Detection:** We look for unique JAR signatures (e.g., \`paper-1.20.jar\`, \`forge-installer.jar\`, or \`fabric-server-launch.jar\`).
*   **Version Scraping:** File names are parsed using regex to identify the exact Minecraft version (e.g., \`1.20.4\`).
*   **Port Extraction:** We parse your \`server.properties\` to find your custom \`server-port\`.
*   **Java Optimization:** Based on the Minecraft version, we automatically assign the correct Java Runtime (e.g., Java 21 for 1.20.5+).

## 3. Integrity Checks
*   **No Overlaps:** The system prevents you from importing a folder that is already being managed by another server instance.
*   **Path Normalization:** All paths are converted to absolute, cross-platform literals to ensure the backend can always find your files, even after a reboot.

        description: "Infrastructure accountability and audit trails.",
        content: `
# Security & Audit Architecture

CraftCommand is built for accountability. Every action taken on the dashboard is tracked and verifiable.

## 1. The Audit Trail
The **AuditService** records a persistent log of every management event:
*   **Who:** The User ID and Email of the person performing the action.
*   **What:** The specific action (e.g., \`START_SERVER\`, \`DELETE_BACKUP\`, \`UPDATE_SETTINGS\`).
*   **Where:** The source IP address and the specific Server ID targeted.
*   **When:** High-resolution millisecond timestamps.

## 2. Metadata Context
Beyond a simple text log, we store "JSON Snapshots" of the event metadata. For example, if you change a server's RAM, the audit log stores both the old and new values, allowing you to trace infrastructure changes over time.

## 3. Sandboxing (Docker)
For maximum security, we recommend the **Docker Execution Engine**:
*   **File Isolation:** The Minecraft process cannot "see" outside its assigned folder.
*   **Resource Caps:** You can strictly limit the CPU and RAM usage at the OS level, preventing one server from crashing your entire host machine.
*   **Network Barriers:** Containers can be isolated on a private virtual bridge, with only the Minecraft port exposed.

## 4. Multi-User Hierarchy
*   **Administrator:** Full access to global settings and all server instances.
*   **Operator:** Access to specific server consoles and file management.
*   **Viewer:** Read-only access to status and telemetry.

        content: `
# Java Management & Runtimes

Minecraft's evolution requires different Java versions. CraftCommand takes the headache out of managing these dependencies through automated lifecycle management.

## 1. Automated Runtimes (Portable Java)
If you don't have the correct Java version installed globally, the **JavaManager** takes over:
*   **Adoptium Handshake:** We interface with the Adoptium Temurin API to fetch official, high-performance OpenJDK builds.
*   **Portable Isolation:** Java is downloaded and extracted into the \`runtimes/\` directory. This means you can run Minecraft 1.8 (Java 8) and Minecraft 1.21 (Java 21) on the same machine without any global environment conflicts.

## 2. Smart Version Mapping
Selecting the wrong Java version causes a \`UnsupportedClassVersionError\`. CraftCommand includes a built-in mapping engine:
*   **Legacy (1.8 - 1.12):** Automatically maps to **Java 8**.
*   **Transition (1.16):** Maps to **Java 11**.
*   **Modern (1.17 - 1.20.4):** Maps to **Java 17**.
*   **Cutting Edge (1.20.5+):** Maps to **Java 21**.

## 3. Docker Image Translation
When using the Docker engine, the system translates your Java choice into a specific container tag (e.g., \`eclipse-temurin:21-jre\`). This ensures that your containerized environment is perfectly tuned for your server's flight path.

## 4. Integrity Checks
During the download phase, the system performs **Size Verification**. If a download is interrupted or the file is too small (<50MB), the system flags a corruption error and rolls back to prevent a broken installation.
